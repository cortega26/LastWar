Your base is your lifeline in *Last War: Survival*. Building and upgrading structures unlocks new features, increases production and training capacity, and provides better protection against zombie hordes and enemy commanders. This guide explains the different building types, how to set up your base in the early game, and construction strategies to maximise your growth.

Estimate upgrade costs with the [Tier 10 upgrade calculator](T10-calculator.html) and maximise resource output using the [protein farm calculator](protein-farm-calculator.html).

## Getting Started

In the beginning, clear the zombie‑occupied sectors around your HQ to free up space for new structures. Prioritise constructing your headquarters and basic production buildings such as the gold mine, farmland and iron mine. Recruit a few heroes (e.g., Gump, Mason or Ambolt) and survivors as soon as you can; heroes lead squads while survivors grant passive bonuses to production and research. Keep your HQ and production facilities upgrading continuously, train troops and heal the wounded, and join an alliance for additional support.

## Building Types & Functions

The game divides structures into several broad categories:

- **Headquarters:** The central building that unlocks new structures and increases the maximum level of other buildings. Upgrading your HQ should be a top priority because it gates most progression.
- **Production buildings:** Gold mines, farmlands, iron mines, material workshops, foundries, drone component labs, chip labs and equipment factories generate the resources your army needs.
- **Military buildings:** Barracks and training grounds recruit infantry; the tank, aircraft and rocket factories produce vehicles; troop stations increase marching capacity; the drone center unlocks drones; the tavern recruits heroes; the spy plane allows long‑range reconnaissance; and your base wall holds defensive turrets.
- **Research & technology buildings:** Research labs, virus research centers and alloy factories improve production rates and troop capabilities through technology.
- **Support buildings:** Hospitals and emergency centers heal troops; vaults protect resources; construction offices and decoration galleries provide efficiency buffs; to‑do lists and alarm towers help you manage tasks.
- **Seasonal buildings:** During special seasons, new structures appear. Season 1 introduces protein farms and virus research institutes, while Season 2 adds titanium alloy factories, high‑temperature furnaces and alliance furnaces.

## Construction Tips

To build efficiently, time your upgrades during the “Expanding the Base” event and other construction competitions; stacking these bonuses can dramatically reduce construction time. Run for ministerial offices in your alliance to gain construction speed buffs and use professional skills like *Building Together* or *Build Now* for free speed‑ups. Always request alliance aid to shave off hours from big projects. Investing in a second building queue is one of the best value purchases in the game.

Progressing quickly means pushing your HQ level. Rush to at least level 15 early on—doing so unlocks additional buildings and stronger troops. Keep multiple upgrades, research tasks and troop training queues running at all times. Finally, join an active alliance; alliance donations and helps will accelerate your growth and provide protection against attackers.
