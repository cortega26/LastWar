Heroes lead your squads into battle and provide powerful bonuses. Each hero belongs to a class (tank, damage dealer or support) and wields unique skills that synergise with certain troops. Investing in the right heroes is key to dominating PvE and PvP content.

Test different lineups with the [interactive Last War team builder](team-builder.html) and review how rankings shift in the [Season 4 Evernight Isle guide](season4.html).

## Hero Roles

- **Tanks:** These heroes soak damage and protect your damage dealers. Some tanks also provide buffs or crowd control. Notable tanks include *Marshall*, who also buffs allies, and *Kimberly*, an offensive tank with high survivability.
- **Damage dealers:** Focused on dealing massive damage, these heroes shine when paired with the right troops. Examples include *DVA* and *Morrison* for aircraft squads, and *Tesla* and *Fiona* for missile squads.
- **Support:** Support heroes provide healing, buffs or debuffs. *Mason* boosts back‑row damage and healing, while *Murphy* offers strong defensive buffs. Having a good support hero dramatically increases your army’s survivability.

## Top Heroes

### SS Tier

- **Marshall (Tank Support):** A versatile tank who reduces damage taken, heals allies and increases squad survivability. Marshall remains dominant across all seasons and scales well with Desert Blessing buffs.
- **Kimberly (Tank Attack):** Combines the bulk of a tank with high damage. She is easy to acquire early on and remains useful through late game, especially when paired with tanks or rocket troops.
- **DVA (Aircraft Attack):** One of the highest damage dealers in the game. DVA excels in both PvE and PvP content and synergises with aircraft troops for devastating aerial strikes.
- **Morrison (Aircraft Attack):** Works alongside DVA as a second aircraft damage dealer, making aircraft squads extremely potent. Morrison’s skills amplify critical hits and burst damage.
- **Tesla (Missile Attack):** A premier missile hero who increases rocket damage and triggers powerful area‑of‑effect attacks. Tesla pairs well with missile troops and shines during world boss battles.
- **Fiona (Missile Attack):** Another top rocket hero, Fiona buffs missile damage and provides sustained DPS. She is particularly effective when combined with Tesla.

### S Tier

- **Williams:** A balanced hero with strong attack and defensive stats. Williams excels in mixed squads and is a solid investment if you lack SS tier heroes.
- **Mason:** A support hero who boosts healing and back‑row damage. Mason is invaluable in Alliance Exercise and world boss events.
- **Murphy:** Provides defensive buffs and crowd control, making him ideal for tanking world boss hits and protecting fragile damage dealers.
- **Carlie, Stetmann, Lucius, Schuyler, Adam & Swift:** These heroes offer a mix of offensive and defensive skills. While not quite SS tier, they are still excellent additions to specialised squads.

### A Tier

- **Mason, Violet & McGregor:** Good performers who can fill gaps in your roster. They are worth investing in if you already have your SS and S tier heroes sorted.

As new heroes are released in future seasons, the meta may shift. Always check the latest patch notes and community discussions to decide which heroes to upgrade. Prioritise heroes that complement your main troop type and fit your preferred play style.
