Welcome to **LastWar Tools**, your strategic companion for *Last War: Survival*.  This site consolidates guides on heroes, base building, alliances and alliance rules to help you maximise your power and efficiency.  Use the navigation above or the links below to explore each section.

## Guides

The following pages contain the core content migrated from the original LastWar site.  Styles have been simplified so that the focus remains on the information itself, while the design comes from the Minimal Mistakes theme.

- [Heroes & Tier List](/pages/heroes.html): learn about hero roles, top heroes and tier lists.
- [Base Building & Development](/pages/base-building.html): guidelines for constructing and upgrading your base.
- [Alliances & Social Play](/pages/alliances.html): benefits of joining an alliance, contributing, events and best practices.
- [Decalogue of a Strong Alliance](/pages/rules.html): ten commandments for maintaining a strong and united alliance.

## Tools

Several interactive calculators and tools from the original site—including upgrade calculators, protein farm calculators and team builders—are not fully integrated here.  They remain available in the original repository and will be re‑introduced in a future update.  For now, focus on the guides above to build a solid foundation.
