      Resources fuel everything you do in <em>Last War: Survival</em> - from
      constructing buildings to recruiting heroes and powering your base
      through seasonal storms. This page summarises the various resources and
      how to obtain them efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Resources</h2>
    <p>
      The core resources are food, gold and iron. You produce these in your
      farmland, gold mine and iron mine respectively; upgrade these buildings
      regularly to increase output. You can also gather from resource tiles on
      the world map, attack zombie hordes and plunder armoured trucks for
      large hauls. Keep a reserve in your vault to prevent enemies from
      stealing everything during raids.
    </p>

    <h2>Special Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immune proteins &amp; mutated crystals:</strong> Seasonal
        resources used in The Crimson Plague. Produce proteins in your
        protein farm and earn crystals by killing zombies, vaccinating
        infected members and completing seasonal missions.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Titanium alloy, coal &amp; rare earth:</strong> Introduced in
        Polar Storm, titanium is made in titanium factories and coal is
        harvested from excavation sites, zombie bosses and radar missions. Coal
        fuels furnaces to warm your base while rare earths drop from owning
        cities and determine your season ranking.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mithril:</strong> A rare metal introduced in Season 3 that
        powers the Blessing Fountain in the Golden Kingdom. Obtain mithril by
        capturing Digging Strongholds, completing Faction War missions and
        defeating high‑level Doom Walkers. Save your radar missions to quickly
        locate Desert Ruin missions when the season starts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shards &amp; Drone Parts</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Hero shards</strong> are used to recruit and upgrade heroes.
      Generic gold shards can be spent on any hero, while specific shards are
      tied to a particular character. You can acquire shards from many
      sources: winning Warzone capitol fights, refreshing secret missions,
      purchasing from the campaign, honour and VIP stores, spending alliance
      points and opening reward chests. Dispatched trucks yield eight to
      twelve shards per run, trains may drop four shards and completing
      daily Arms Race goals awards bonus shards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Drone parts</strong> level up your combat drone. You can earn up
      to six parts per day from daily task chests. Drone missions and radar
      missions can each drop up to fifteen parts if you hit the multiplier.
    </p>

    <h2>Diamonds &amp; Premium Currency</h2>
    <p>
      Diamonds are the premium currency. Free‑to‑play players can still earn
      a fair amount: daily tasks and chests yield over a hundred diamonds; alliance
      tech donations grant dozens more; free mall chests offer small bundles
      each day; Warzone capitol chests drop hundreds; tapping the thumbs up
      icons in the arena’s 3v3 brawl awards daily diamonds; Duel VS
      rankings provide weekly payouts; radar missions sometimes reveal
      diamond mines worth up to a hundred; digging for treasures can double
      your haul; and the Marshall exercise offers diamond rewards several
      times a week.
    </p>

    <h2>Resource Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever possible, leave resources in the form of boxes in your inventory
      rather than opening them immediately. Unopened resources cannot be
      plundered by other commanders if they break through your walls. Use
      vaults to protect a portion of your resources and shield your base
      during PvP events. Farming alt accounts or plundering trucks in other
      servers are effective ways to boost your reserves.
