The world of *Last War: Survival* is harsh, but you don’t have to face it alone.  Alliances are cooperatives of commanders who share resources, technology and protection.  Joining an active alliance early unlocks many of the game’s systems and helps you progress faster.

## Why Join an Alliance?

- **Alliance gifts & trains:** As members spend and complete events, they generate gift chests and trains that deliver resources and speed‑ups to every member.  These gifts provide a steady flow of speed‑ups, resources and hero shards without extra effort.
- **Alliance aid:** When you start a long upgrade or research project, other members can tap a help button to reduce the timer. Each help shaves a small percentage off the remaining time, so the more helps you receive the faster your buildings and research finish.
- **Shared territory & buildings:** Alliances can claim territory on the world map.  Building cannons, hospitals and other structures within this territory grants buffs and healing to all members.  During seasonal campaigns, alliances can control cities or excavation sites to collect special resources and rare earths.
- **Exclusive shop:** Alliance points earned from donations can be spent on shields, hero fragments, speed‑ups and other valuable items.  Higher level alliance research unlocks better items in the shop.
- **Protection & scouting:** Alliance members share reports about incoming attacks and can reinforce each other.  Being in a strong, active alliance makes you a less appealing target because attackers know your allies will respond.

## Contributing & Rewards

Alliances have research trees that grant bonuses to all members.  Donate resources regularly to unlock these technologies and earn contribution points.  Every week, alliances receive rank‑based rewards in events like Desert Storm and City Clash.  High‑level alliance capitals provide end‑of‑season chests and exclusive decorations.  Remember to claim your daily alliance gifts and help your allies before you log off so everyone benefits.

## Events & Free Teleports

Many alliance‑wide events dot the calendar: Duels pit alliances against each other for points; Desert Storm is a timed battle over buildings; Ghost Ops sends members on cooperative missions; and City Clash determines who will rule the server capital.  On the sixth day of Duel VS, you can use the Alliance Assault page to teleport to another server and back for free.  This trick allows you to avoid attackers or plunder other servers without spending diamonds and is only available on the sixth day of the duel week.

During Honorable Campaign or other PvE events, your alliance can rally against bosses.  Coordinate with your R4/R5 (leaders) to ensure everyone gets a spot in rallies and benefits from shared rewards.  Always communicate in chat or Discord to organise attacks and defense.

## Best Practices

- Donate daily to alliance tech and request helps whenever possible.  This simple habit accelerates your build and research times because every donation grants contribution points and every help reduces timers.
- Ask your alliance which territory to build and focus on.  Scattering buildings wastes resources; coordinated placement offers bigger buffs.
- Use the free server teleport on Duel day 6 to escape attacks, plunder resources or relocate to safety without consuming a teleport item.
- Always shield up if you plan to be offline during a PvP event.  A sleeping base with no shield is an easy target and may lose resources and troops.
