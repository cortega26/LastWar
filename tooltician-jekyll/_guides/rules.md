Our ten commandments for a strong and united alliance:

1. **Respect and Team Spirit:** Always be respectful, polite, and helpful.  We thrive through unity and cooperation.
2. **Stay Active:** Consistent activity is vital, especially for Free‑to‑Play (F2P) members.
3. **Inform if you're going inactive:** If you're going offline for more than 24 hours, notify R4 or R5.  Unexplained inactivity can lead to removal for the sake of active coordination.
4. **Daily Contributions:** Donate to alliance tech **every day**.  It boosts everyone and is the foundation of our growth.
5. **Event Participation is Mandatory:** Participate in all major events: Marshall's Guard, Desert Storm, Winter Storm, Capitol War, SVS and any new official events.
6. **Rally Responsibly:** During events like *Zombie Invasion*, never rally bosses if you can't tank them.  Coordinate your rallies to avoid waste.
7. **Organized Base Placement:** Place your base **in grid formation**, aligned with the alliance structure.  Ask if you're unsure where to position.
8. **Shielding Protocol:** Follow shield instructions during SVS and Buster Day.
9. **Level Up Strategically:** Keep improving your **troops, buildings, and hero levels**.  A strong player means a strong alliance.
10. **Communication:** Active chat participation is encouraged but not required.  However, reading announcements and in‑game officer emails is mandatory.  You must be able to follow instructions.
