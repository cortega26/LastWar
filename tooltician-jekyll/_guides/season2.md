      <h2>üå¨Ô∏è Season 2 Overview: The Polar Storm</h2>
      <p>
        Season 2 moves gameplay to a frozen polar region with extreme weather,
        new strategic buildings, and crucial resources.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature Mechanics:</strong> Temperatures drop toward the
          Capitol; your base needs to stay warm to function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New Building: High-Heat Furnace</strong> - Burns
          <strong>Coal</strong> to heat your base and increase
          <strong>Virus Resistance</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alliance Furnace:</strong> Shared heat radius for your team.
          Keep it running 24/7.
        </li>
        <li><strong>New Resources:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Coal</strong> (for heat and upgrades)</li>
        <li><strong>Titanium Alloy</strong> (for Furnace upgrades)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Virus Resistance:</strong> Essential for fighting stronger
          infected. Tied to Furnace upgrades and zombie kills.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Buy Battle Pass and Tower of Victory for strong seasonal buffs.
