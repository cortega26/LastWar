Heroes lead your squads into battle and provide powerful bonuses. Each hero belongs to a class (tank, damage dealer or support) and wields unique skills that synergise with certain troops. Investing in the right heroes is key to dominating PvE and PvP content.

Test different lineups with the [interactive Last War team builder](/calculators/team-builder/) and review how rankings shift in the [Season 4 Evernight Isle guide](/guides/season4/).

## Hero Roles

- **Tanks:** These heroes soak damage and protect your damage dealers. Some tanks also provide buffs or crowd control. Notable tanks include *Marshall*, who also buffs allies, and *Kimberly*, an offensive tank with high survivability.
- **Damage dealers:** Focused on dealing massive damage, these heroes shine when paired with the right troops. Examples include *DVA* and *Morrison* for aircraft squads, and *Tesla* and *Fiona* for missile squads.
- **Support:** Support heroes provide healing, buffs or debuffs. *Mason* boosts back‑row damage and healing, while *Murphy* offers strong defensive buffs. Having a good support hero dramatically increases your army’s survivability.
