Your base is your lifeline in *Last War: Survival*. Building and upgrading structures unlocks new features, increases production and training capacity, and provides better protection against zombie hordes and enemy commanders. This guide explains the different building types, how to set up your base in the early game, and construction strategies to maximise your growth.

Estimate upgrade costs with the [Tier 10 upgrade calculator](/calculators/t10-calculator/) and maximise resource output using the [protein farm calculator](/calculators/protein-farm-calculator/).

## Getting Started

In the beginning, clear the zombie‑occupied sectors around your HQ to free up space for new structures. Prioritise constructing your headquarters and basic production buildings such as the gold mine, farmland and iron mine. Recruit a few heroes (e.g., Gump, Mason or Ambolt) and survivors as soon as you can; heroes lead squads while survivors grant passive bonuses to production and research. Keep your HQ and production facilities upgrading continuously, train troops and heal the wounded, and join an alliance for additional support.

## Building Types & Functions

The game divides structures into several broad categories:

- **HQ & Command:** The headquarters unlocks new buildings and features. The command center manages troop dispatch slots and rally capacity.
- **Production Buildings:** Gold mines, farms, iron mines and protein factories generate resources. Upgrade them to increase output.
- **Military Buildings:** Barracks, airfields and missile platforms train troops. Hospitals heal casualties and should be upgraded alongside troop tiers.
- **Research Facilities:** The institute unlocks technology trees. Research boosts production, combat stats and efficiency.

## Early Game Layout

Place production buildings close together to minimise march times for collection quests. Keep military buildings near the HQ for faster training. Use roads to connect structures and gain small speed bonuses. As you unlock more territory, arrange buildings in clusters to optimise space.

## Construction Tips

- Keep builders busy at all times. Use speed‑ups on long upgrades to maintain momentum.
- Upgrade warehouses to protect resources from raids.
- Focus on HQ levels that unlock new features before maxing other buildings.
- Join an active alliance for construction boosts and help from allies.
