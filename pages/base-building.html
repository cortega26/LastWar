    <p>
      Your base is your lifeline in <em>Last War: Survival</em>. Building and
      upgrading structures unlocks new features, increases production and
      training capacity, and provides better protection against zombie
      hordes and enemy commanders. This page explains the different
      building types, how to set up your base in the early game, and
      construction strategies to maximise your growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning, clear the zombie‑occupied sectors around your HQ to
      free up space for new structures. Prioritise constructing your
      headquarters and basic production buildings such as the gold mine,
      farmland and iron mine. Recruit a few
      heroes (e.g., Gump, Mason or Ambolt) and survivors as soon as you can;
      heroes lead squads while survivors grant passive bonuses to
      production and research. Keep your HQ and
      production facilities upgrading continuously, train troops and
      heal the wounded, and join an alliance for additional support.
    </p>

    <h2>Building Types &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p>The game divides structures into several broad categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Headquarters:</strong> The central building that unlocks new
        structures and increases the maximum level of other buildings. Upgrading
        your HQ should be a top priority because it gates most progression.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Production buildings:</strong> Gold mines, farmlands, iron mines,
        material workshops, foundries, drone component labs, chip labs and
        equipment factories generate the resources your army needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Military buildings:</strong> Barracks and training grounds
        recruit infantry; the tank, aircraft and rocket factories produce
        vehicles; troop stations increase marching capacity; the drone center
        unlocks drones; the tavern recruits heroes; the spy plane allows long‑range
        reconnaissance; and your base wall holds defensive turrets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Research &amp; technology buildings:</strong> Research labs,
        virus research centers and alloy factories improve production rates
        and troop capabilities through technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support buildings:</strong> Hospitals and emergency centers heal
        troops; vaults protect resources; construction offices and decoration
        galleries provide efficiency buffs; to‑do lists and alarm towers help
        you manage tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonal buildings:</strong> During special seasons, new
        structures appear. Season 1 introduces protein farms and virus
        research institutes, while Season 2 adds titanium alloy factories,
        high‑temperature furnaces and alliance furnaces.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Construction Tips</h2>
    <p>
      To build efficiently, time your upgrades during the “Expanding the Base”
      event and other construction competitions; stacking these bonuses can
      dramatically reduce construction time. Run for
      ministerial offices in your alliance to gain construction speed buffs
      and use professional skills like <em>Building Together</em> or <em>Build
        Now</em> for free speed‑ups. Always request
      alliance aid to shave off hours from big projects. Investing in a second
      building queue is one of the best value purchases in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progressing quickly means pushing your HQ level. Rush to at least level 15
      early on—doing so unlocks additional buildings and stronger troops. Keep
      multiple upgrades, research tasks and troop training queues running at
      all times. Finally, join an active alliance; alliance donations and
      helps will accelerate your growth and provide protection against
      attackers.
