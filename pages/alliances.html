      <p>
        The world of <em>Last War: Survival</em> is harsh, but you don’t have to
        face it alone. Alliances are cooperatives of commanders who share
        resources, technology and protection. Joining an active alliance early
        unlocks many of the game’s systems and helps you progress faster.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Join an Alliance?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alliance gifts &amp; trains:</strong> As members spend and
          complete events, they generate gift chests and trains that deliver
          resources and speed‑ups to every member【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Alliance aid:</strong> When you start a long upgrade or
          research, other members can tap a help button to reduce the timer. The
          more helps you receive, the shorter the remaining time【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shared territory &amp; buildings:</strong> Alliances can
          claim territory, build powerful structures like cannons and hospitals,
          and even control cities or excavation sites during seasons【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exclusive shop:</strong> Alliance points earned from
          donations can be spent on shields, hero fragments, speed‑ups and other
          valuable items【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Protection &amp; scouting:</strong> Alliance members share
          reports about incoming attacks and can reinforce each other. Being in a
          strong alliance makes you a less appealing target.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contributing &amp; Rewards</h2>
      <p>
        Alliances have research trees that grant bonuses to all members. Donate
        resources regularly to unlock these technologies and earn contribution
        points. Every week, alliances receive rank‑based rewards in events like
        Desert Storm and City Clash. High‑level alliance capitals provide
        end‑of‑season chests and exclusive decorations【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        Remember to claim your daily alliance gifts and help your allies before
        you log off.
      </p>

      <h2>Events &amp; Free Teleports</h2>
      <p>
        Many alliance‑wide events dot the calendar: Duels pit alliances against
        each other for points; Desert Storm is a timed battle over buildings;
        Ghost Ops sends members on cooperative missions; and City Clash
        determines who will rule the server capital. On the sixth day of Duel
        VS, you can use the Alliance Assault page to teleport to another server
        and back for free【694815160878841†L78-L83】. This trick allows you to
        avoid attackers or plunder other servers without spending diamonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Honorable Campaign or other PvE events, your alliance can rally
        against bosses. Coordinate with your R4/R5 (leaders) to ensure everyone
        gets a spot in rallies and benefits from shared rewards. Always
        communicate in chat or Discord to organise attacks and defense【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Donate daily to alliance tech and request helps whenever possible. This
          simple habit accelerates your build and research times【800064550822373†L137-L254】.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask your alliance which territory to build and focus on. Scattering
          buildings wastes resources; coordinated placement offers bigger buffs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the free server teleport on Duel day 6 to escape attacks, plunder
          resources or relocate to safety without consuming a teleport item【694815160878841†L78-L83】.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always shield up if you plan to be offline during a PvP event. A
          sleeping base with no shield is an easy target【694815160878841†L110-L111】.
        </li>
      </ul>
