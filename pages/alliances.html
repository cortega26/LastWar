      <h1>Alliances &amp; Social Play</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      The world of <em>Last War: Survival</em> is harsh, but you don’t have to
      face it alone. Alliances are cooperatives of commanders who share
      resources, technology and protection. Joining an active alliance early
      unlocks many of the game’s systems and helps you progress faster.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Join an Alliance?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alliance gifts &amp; trains:</strong> As members spend and
        complete events, they generate gift chests and trains that deliver
        resources and speed‑ups to every member. These gifts provide a steady
        flow of speed‑ups, resources and hero shards without extra effort.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Alliance aid:</strong> When you start a long upgrade or
        research project, other members can tap a help button to reduce the
        timer. Each help shaves a small percentage off the remaining time, so
        the more helps you receive the faster your buildings and research
        finish.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Shared territory &amp; buildings:</strong> Alliances can
        claim territory on the world map. Building cannons, hospitals and
        other structures within this territory grants buffs and healing to
        all members. During seasonal campaigns, alliances can control cities
        or excavation sites to collect special resources and rare earths.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Exclusive shop:</strong> Alliance points earned from
        donations can be spent on shields, hero fragments, speed‑ups and other
        valuable items. Higher level alliance research unlocks better items in
        the shop.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Protection &amp; scouting:</strong> Alliance members share
        reports about incoming attacks and can reinforce each other. Being in
        a strong, active alliance makes you a less appealing target because
        attackers know your allies will respond.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contributing &amp; Rewards</h2>
    <p>
      Alliances have research trees that grant bonuses to all members. Donate
      resources regularly to unlock these technologies and earn contribution
      points. Every week, alliances receive rank‑based rewards in events like
      Desert Storm and City Clash. High‑level alliance capitals provide
      end‑of‑season chests and exclusive decorations. Remember to claim
      your daily alliance gifts and help your allies before you log off so
      everyone benefits.
    </p>

    <h2>Events &amp; Free Teleports</h2>
    <p>
      Many alliance‑wide events dot the calendar: Duels pit alliances against
      each other for points; Desert Storm is a timed battle over buildings;
      Ghost Ops sends members on cooperative missions; and City Clash
      determines who will rule the server capital. On the sixth day of Duel
      VS, you can use the Alliance Assault page to teleport to another server
      and back for free. This trick allows you to avoid attackers or plunder
      other servers without spending diamonds and is only available on the
      sixth day of the duel week.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Honorable Campaign or other PvE events, your alliance can rally
      against bosses. Coordinate with your R4/R5 (leaders) to ensure everyone
      gets a spot in rallies and benefits from shared rewards. Always
      communicate in chat or Discord to organise attacks and defense.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Donate daily to alliance tech and request helps whenever possible. This
        simple habit accelerates your build and research times because every
        donation grants contribution points and every help reduces timers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask your alliance which territory to build and focus on. Scattering
        buildings wastes resources; coordinated placement offers bigger buffs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the free server teleport on Duel day 6 to escape attacks, plunder
        resources or relocate to safety without consuming a teleport item.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always shield up if you plan to be offline during a PvP event. A
        sleeping base with no shield is an easy target and may lose
        resources and troops.
      </li>
    </ul>
