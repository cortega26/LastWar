          Welcome to a complete guide to

        </p>
        <h2>🌬️ Season 2 Overview: The Polar Storm</h2>
        <p>
          Season 2 moves gameplay to a frozen polar region with extreme weather,
          new strategic buildings, and crucial resources.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Temperature Mechanics:</strong> Temperatures drop toward the
            Capitol; your base needs to stay warm to function.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>New Building: High-Heat Furnace</strong> – Burns
            <strong>Coal</strong> to heat your base and increase
            <strong>Virus Resistance</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alliance Furnace:</strong> Shared heat radius for your team.
            Keep it running 24/7.
          </li>
          <li><strong>New Resources:</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Coal</strong> (for heat and upgrades)</li>
          <li><strong>Titanium Alloy</strong> (for Furnace upgrades)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Virus Resistance:</strong> Essential for fighting stronger
            infected. Tied to Furnace upgrades and zombie kills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>🌟 Day 1 Strategy &amp; Early Game Progression</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Season Prep:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stack rewards: Delay claiming Doom Walker kill until Season 2 for
            bonus <strong>Coal</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy Battle Pass and Tower of Victory for strong seasonal buffs.
          </li>
          <li>Coordinate alliance start zone location.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>First Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build &amp; level all <strong>Titanium Alloy Factories</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Upgrade <strong>High-Heat Furnace</strong> immediately.</li>
          <li>
            Kill high-level <strong>infected</strong> early for fast Virus
            Resistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designate 1-3 high-resistance players to monopolize seasonal
            resources &amp; lead rallies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Build Order Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Level all factories evenly.</li>
          <li>Check Furnace milestone goals after each upgrade.</li>

          <li>Park near Alliance Furnace or a City during Cold Waves.</li>
          <li>
            Don’t let your base freeze — production, healing, and troop morale
            suffer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <strong>Engineer profession</strong> for economic buffs and

            and temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rally leaders must have high Virus Resistance – it applies to all
            members.
          </li>
          <li>
            Capture all sites attached to a City for maximum Rare Soil
            production.
          </li>
