      <h1>Seasonal Gameplay</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      Seasons are major campaigns that introduce new mechanics, buildings and
      resources to <em>Last War: Survival</em>. Each season runs for several
      weeks and culminates in a capital battle between alliances. The
      summaries below cover the first three seasons, highlighting the core
      objectives and strategies you’ll need to succeed.
    </p>

    <h2>Season 1 – The Crimson Plague</h2>
    <p>
      The inaugural season tasks commanders with building virus immunity to
      survive a deadly plague. New resources called <strong>immune
        proteins</strong> are produced in protein farms and processed in the
      virus research institute; <strong>mutated crystals</strong> and
      <strong>gene fragments</strong> are used to upgrade these facilities and
      recombine heroes’ DNA. Gene fragments drop from killing zombies,
      vaccinating infected members, spreading the virus, completing radar
      missions and attacking cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Season 1 introduces several structures: the <em>protein farm</em>
      produces immune proteins, the <em>virus research institute</em> studies
      immunity, seasonal <em>military bases</em> allow you to train unique
      troops, and the <em>professional hall</em> lets commanders specialise
      into engineers or war leaders. Recommended early‑season skills include
      <em>exceptional contribution</em>, <em>combat experience</em>,
      <em>building inspiration</em> and <em>free construction</em> for faster
      progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      To thrive in The Crimson Plague, support low‑resistance teammates by
      sending immune proteins, level your protein farms evenly to avoid
      shortages, vaccinate infected allies to gain gene fragments, upgrade
      Mason to UR as soon as possible, and reset your professional skills as
      needed. Don’t forget to garrison troops during Legion of Blood attacks
      and purchase the “Tower of Victory” decoration for a head start in
      Season 2.
    </p>

    <h2>Season 2 – Polar Storm</h2>
    <p>
      The second season introduces freezing weather. Bases now have a
      temperature bar; if your HQ temperature falls below −20 °C your base
      freezes for five minutes. You must build
      <strong>titanium alloy factories</strong> and upgrade them rapidly to
      produce the alloy needed for the new <strong>high‑temperature
        furnaces</strong>. Furnaces burn <strong>coal</strong> to keep your base
      warm, increase production and improve healing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coal is harvested from excavation sites, zombie bosses, seasonal events
      and radar missions. Donations of coal to the alliance furnace boost
      heat for all members. Rare earths drop from owning cities and
      excavation sites and determine your ranking at season end.
      Temperature zones become colder toward the capital, ranging from −15 °C
      to −80 °C; prepare your furnace accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips for Polar Storm include: upgrade titanium factories to level 15
      quickly then level them evenly; maintain base temperature above
      −20 °C; use the spy plane to thaw frozen allies; pre‑heat your base
      before launching attacks to increase morale; donate surplus coal to the
      alliance furnace; capture cities and excavation sites for rare earths;
      and remember that only alliances with a level‑6 city may contest the
      Capitol.
    </p>

    <h2>Season 3 – Golden Kingdom</h2>
    <p>
      The third season transports commanders to the <em>Golden Kingdom</em>, a
      sprawling desert region infused with ancient magic. Your alliance will
      establish a base in this new territory, construct <strong>Blessing
        Fountains</strong> to gain powerful buffs and battle over resource‑rich
      strongholds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Season 3’s key resource is <strong>mithril</strong>, a rare metal used to
      upgrade the Blessing Fountain. Mithril can be earned by capturing
      Digging Strongholds, completing Faction War missions and killing
      high‑level Doom Walkers that appear around the map. Save your radar
      missions before the season begins to quickly find Desert Ruin missions
      once the season starts and target the highest level Doom Walkers to
      maximise mithril rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      To grow quickly, purchase the seasonal battle pass and weekly pass,
      relocate your alliance near high‑level cities or less populated areas
      at the start of the season and coordinate your attacks on resource
      nodes. Hold off attacking Doom Walkers until the season begins so that
      their first‑kill rewards count toward Season 3 objectives. Invest in
      the <em>Master Craftsman</em> technology, the Engineer’s <em>Resource
        Saving</em> skill and your alliance’s <em>Veteran Craftsman</em> tech to
      reduce construction costs. Always choose the cheapest available
      Blessing Fountain upgrade to maximise your mithril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land capture becomes even more important in the Golden Kingdom. Rally
      with high‑resistance players to take cities and Digging Strongholds
      that provide hourly mithril income. During Faction War events,
      complete missions quickly, use war fever buffs for extra damage and
      coordinate your alliance to secure key objectives. Upgrading heroes
      such as Marshall, Kimberly, DVA, Morrison, Tesla, Fiona and other
      Desert Blessing heroes will give you an edge, and collecting shards
      for Scarlett and other new heroes will pay off in later seasons.
