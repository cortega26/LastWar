        <h1>Seasonal Gameplay</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Seasons are major campaigns that introduce new mechanics, buildings and
        resources to <em>Last War: Survival</em>. Each season lasts roughly
        eight weeks and culminates in a capital battle between alliances. The
        information below covers the first two seasons released so far.
      </p>

      <h2>Season 1 – The Crimson Plague</h2>
      <p>
        The inaugural season tasks commanders with building virus immunity to
        survive a deadly plague. New resources called <strong>immune
        proteins</strong> are produced in protein farms and processed in the
        virus research institute; <strong>mutated crystals</strong> and
        <strong>gene fragments</strong> are used to upgrade these facilities and
        recombine heroes’ DNA【522118572126250†L45-L139】. Gene fragments drop from
        killing zombies, vaccinating infected members, spreading the virus,
        completing radar missions and attacking cities【522118572126250†L45-L139】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Season 1 introduces several structures: the <em>protein farm</em>
        produces immune proteins, the <em>virus research institute</em> studies
        immunity, seasonal <em>military bases</em> allow you to train unique
        troops, and the <em>professional hall</em> lets commanders specialise
        into engineers or war leaders【522118572126250†L45-L139】. Recommended
        early‑season skills include <em>exceptional contribution</em>, <em>combat
        experience</em>, <em>building inspiration</em> and <em>free
        construction</em>【522118572126250†L185-L205】.
      </p>
      <p>
        To thrive in The Crimson Plague, support low‑resistance teammates by
        sending immune proteins, level your protein farms evenly to avoid
        shortages, vaccinate infected allies to gain gene fragments, upgrade
        Mason to UR as soon as possible, and reset your professional skills as
        needed【522118572126250†L209-L260】. Don’t forget to garrison troops during
        Legion of Blood attacks and purchase the “Tower of Victory” decoration
        for a head start in Season 2【522118572126250†L209-L260】.
      </p>

      <h2>Season 2 – Polar Storm</h2>
      <p>
        The second season introduces freezing weather. Bases now have a
        temperature bar; if your HQ temperature falls below −20 °C your base
        freezes for five minutes【1573696249107†L167-L199】. You must build
        <strong>titanium alloy factories</strong> and upgrade them rapidly to
        produce the alloy needed for the new <strong>high‑temperature
        furnaces</strong>. Furnaces burn <strong>coal</strong> to keep your base
        warm, increase production and improve healing speed【1573696249107†L167-L199】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coal is harvested from excavation sites, zombie bosses, seasonal events
        and radar missions. Donations of coal to the alliance furnace boost
        heat for all members. Rare earths drop from owning cities and
        excavation sites and determine your ranking at season end【1573696249107†L167-L199】.
        Temperature zones become colder toward the capital, ranging from −15 °C
        to −80 °C; prepare your furnace accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tips for Polar Storm include: upgrade titanium factories to level 15
        quickly then level them evenly; maintain base temperature above
        −20 °C; use the spy plane to thaw frozen allies; pre‑heat your base
        before launching attacks to increase morale; donate surplus coal to the
        alliance furnace; capture cities and excavation sites for rare earths;
        and remember that only alliances with a level‑6 city may contest the
        Capitol【1573696249107†L167-L199】.
