      <h1>Events &amp; Special Modes</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      Beyond the daily grind, <em>Last War: Survival</em> features rotating
      events and mini‑games that provide huge rewards. This page summarises
      some of the most important activities and how to maximise your gains.
    </p>

    <h2>Secret Missions &amp; Loot Trucks</h2>
    <p>
      Secret missions and armored trucks spawn all over the world map. The best
      rewards come from purple or golden icons. To get the most out of them,
      search for missions and trucks in other servers: note the warzone ID,
      teleport there, plunder the mission or truck and then return. Early
      mornings usually offer more targets, and each mission can be looted three
      times. You can plunder up to four trucks and five missions per day.
      Share coordinates in alliance chat and avoid plundering on your own
      server to maintain good relations.
    </p>

    <h2>Ghost Ops</h2>
    <p>
      After Season 1, alliances unlock Ghost Ops. On Thursdays, members start
      special UR or SSR missions from the Secret Command Post. Each mission
      requires heroes of a specific rarity or star level; up to four members
      can join to meet the requirement and share rewards. Only start missions
      that match your hero roster and execute them immediately to free your
      heroes for other missions. Continue to help your allies after finishing
      your own runs to gain additional alliance contributions. The event runs
      in four three‑hour windows throughout the day and hero requirements
      increase every week.
    </p>

    <h2>Operation Falcon &amp; Honorable Campaign</h2>
    <p>
      Operation Falcon (a.k.a. Special Ops) rewards free troops equal to the
      highest troop tier you can train. Delay running special ops until your
      barracks have been upgraded so you receive stronger troops. If you get
      stuck in Honorable Campaign, replay earlier stages for resources and
      experience. You can skip the combat animation by pressing the
      back arrow once the battle starts to quickly see the outcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Alliance Exercise &amp; World Boss</h2>
    <p>
      During Alliance Exercise, join rallies organised by your leaders to earn
      points. Activate a <strong>war fever</strong> buff by scouting or
      attacking another commander just before the event; this grants 1% extra
      damage for 15 minutes and can be retriggered every 15 minutes. For the
      World Boss, place heroes like Mason and Violet in the front row so that their
      passives boost the damage of your back‑row attackers. Focus on
      offensive heroes rather than tanks and always join rallies led by high‑level
      commanders for bonus damage.
    </p>

    <h2>Healing &amp; Hospital Tricks</h2>
    <p>
      When healing large numbers of troops, start a queue that matches the
      maximum number of alliance helps you can receive. Request help and then
      cancel any remaining time with speed‑ups; this ensures your alliance
      contributes efficiently. The emergency hospital has a two‑day
      cooldown; after rescuing troops, leave them unclaimed so the cooldown
      starts immediately. Later you can claim them when you actually need
      them.
    </p>

    <h2>Transfer Surge</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Transfer Surge</em> is a survival mode where your team battles
      escalating waves of enemies without any automatic healing between
      rounds. Success comes from building a balanced lineup rather than
      relying on raw power. Use a sturdy tank like Schuyler or Glenn in the
      front line, a support such as Scarlett for shields and healing in the
      middle row, and damage‑dealers like Zoe, Byron or Quinn in the back.
      Save ultimates for the second or third wave in each round - don’t
      trigger them as soon as they’re ready. Time healing and shielding
      abilities after enemy nukes land to maximise their impact and keep your
      team alive. Rewards increase the further you progress, so careful
      placement, synergy and ultimate timing are crucial.
    </p>

    <h2>Frontline Breakthrough</h2>
    <p>
      The Frontline Breakthrough mission adds puzzle‑like stages that
      emphasise positioning and planning. The most challenging levels - such
      as 16 and 40 - require you to destroy barrels and structures in a
      specific order to recruit extra soldiers and open pathways. On
      level&nbsp;16, break the first three barrels to gain troops, then move
      the target onto the left red rectangle to convert it and recruit more
      soldiers. Destroy the AK barrel in the middle, reposition your units
      and keep breaking barrels while avoiding Doom Elite attacks. For
      level&nbsp;40, start with the barrels on the left and centre, recruit
      additional troops, and systematically destroy the remaining barrels while
      keeping your soldiers spread out to minimise splash damage. The key
      across all breakthrough levels is to think ahead and use every barrel
      to your advantage.
