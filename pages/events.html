      <p>
        Beyond the daily grind, <em>Last War: Survival</em> features rotating
        events and mini‑games that provide huge rewards. This page summarises
        some of the most important activities and how to maximise your gains.
      </p>

      <h2>Secret Missions &amp; Loot Trucks</h2>
      <p>
        Secret missions and armored trucks spawn all over the world map. The best
        rewards come from purple or golden icons. To get the most out of them,
        search for missions and trucks in other servers: note the warzone ID,
        teleport there, plunder the mission or truck and then return. Early
        mornings usually offer more targets, and each mission can be looted three
        times. You can plunder up to four trucks and five missions per day.
        Share coordinates in alliance chat and avoid plundering on your own
        server to maintain good relations.
      </p>

      <h2>Ghost Ops</h2>
      <p>
        After Season 1, alliances unlock Ghost Ops. On Thursdays, members start
        special UR or SSR missions from the Secret Command Post. Each mission
        requires heroes of a specific rarity or star level; up to four members
        can join to meet the requirement and share rewards. Only start missions
        that match your hero roster and execute them immediately to free your
        heroes for other missions. Continue to help your allies after finishing
        your own runs to gain additional alliance contributions. The event runs
        in four three‑hour windows throughout the day and hero requirements
        increase every week.
      </p>

      <h2>Operation Falcon &amp; Honorable Campaign</h2>
      <p>
        Operation Falcon (a.k.a. Special Ops) rewards free troops equal to the
        highest troop tier you can train. Delay running special ops until your
        barracks have been upgraded so you receive stronger troops. If you get
        stuck in Honorable Campaign, replay earlier stages for resources and
        experience. You can skip the combat animation by pressing the
        back arrow once the battle starts to quickly see the outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>Alliance Exercise &amp; World Boss</h2>
      <p>
        During Alliance Exercise, join rallies organised by your leaders to earn
        points. Activate a <strong>war fever</strong> buff by scouting or
        attacking another commander just before the event; this grants 1% extra
        damage for 15 minutes and can be retriggered every 15 minutes. For the
        World Boss, place heroes like Mason and Violet in the front row so that their
        passives boost the damage of your back‑row attackers. Focus on
        offensive heroes rather than tanks and always join rallies led by high‑level
        commanders for bonus damage.
      </p>

      <h2>Healing &amp; Hospital Tricks</h2>
      <p>
        When healing large numbers of troops, start a queue that matches the
        maximum number of alliance helps you can receive. Request help and then
        cancel any remaining time with speed‑ups; this ensures your alliance
        contributes efficiently. The emergency hospital has a two‑day
        cooldown; after rescuing troops, leave them unclaimed so the cooldown
        starts immediately. Later you can claim them when you actually need
        them.
