        Resources fuel everything you do in <em>Last War: Survival</em> – from
        constructing buildings to recruiting heroes and powering your base
        through seasonal storms. This page summarises the various resources and
        how to obtain them efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>Basic Resources</h2>
      <p>
        The core resources are food, gold and iron. You produce these in your
        farmland, gold mine and iron mine respectively; upgrade these buildings
        regularly to increase output. You can also gather from resource tiles on
        the world map, attack zombie hordes and plunder armored trucks for large
        hauls. Keep a reserve in your vault to prevent enemies from stealing
        everything during raids【544682748183740†L190-L195】.
      </p>

      <h2>Special Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immune proteins &amp; mutated crystals:</strong> Seasonal
          resources used in The Crimson Plague. Produce proteins in your
          protein farm and earn crystals by killing zombies, vaccinating
          infected members and completing seasonal missions【522118572126250†L45-L139】.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Titanium alloy, coal &amp; rare earth:</strong> Introduced in
          Polar Storm, titanium is made in titanium factories and coal is
          harvested from excavation sites, zombie bosses and radar missions. Coal
          fuels furnaces to warm your base while rare earths drop from owning
          cities and determine your season ranking【1573696249107†L167-L199】.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Shards &amp; Drone Parts</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Hero shards</strong> are used to recruit and upgrade heroes.
        Generic gold shards can be spent on any hero, while specific shards are
        tied to a particular character. You can acquire shards from many
        sources: winning Warzone Capitol fights (five shards), refreshing secret
        missions (up to seven per day), the campaign store (ten per week), the
        honor store (ten per month), the VIP store from level 11 onward (seven
        per week), the alliance store (five per week) and reward chests【544682748183740†L92-L132】. 
        Dispatched trucks yield eight to twelve shards per run, trains may drop
        four shards and completing eighteen Arms Race goals awards two extra
        shards daily【544682748183740†L92-L132】.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Drone parts</strong> level up your combat drone. You can earn up
        to six parts per day from daily task chests. Drone missions and radar
        missions can each drop up to fifteen parts if you hit the multiplier【544682748183740†L134-L146】.
      </p>

      <h2>Diamonds &amp; Premium Currency</h2>
      <p>
        Diamonds are the premium currency. F2P players can still earn a fair
        amount: daily tasks and chests yield up to 110 diamonds; alliance tech
        donations grant 30 per day; free mall chests provide 10 per day; Warzone
        Capitol chests drop up to 700; clicking thumbs in the arena’s 3v3 brawl
        awards 90 per day; Duel VS tiers give 500–2 000 per week depending on
        rank; radar missions sometimes reveal diamond mines worth up to 100;
        digging treasures has a chance to double that value; and the Marshall
        exercise offers diamonds several times a week【544682748183740†L150-L175】.
      </p>

      <h2>Resource Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever possible, leave resources in the form of boxes in your inventory
        rather than opening them immediately. Unopened resources cannot be
        plundered by other commanders if they break through your walls【544682748183740†L190-L195】.
        Use vaults to protect a portion of your resources and shield your base
        during PvP events. Farming alt accounts or plundering trucks in other
        servers are effective ways to boost your reserves【705118852602196†L43-L100】.
