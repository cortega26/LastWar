      <h1>Hidden Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      This collection of tips and tricks covers lesser‑known strategies that
      seasoned commanders use to gain an edge. Some focus on maximising event
      rewards, others on optimising everyday tasks. Use them wisely!
    </p>

    <h2>Event &amp; Reward Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bullseye Loot &amp; Ammo Bonanza:</strong> Save up ammunition
        from daily tasks and packs until a Bullseye Loot event arrives. Use
        your entire stash in one session to reach the higher reward tiers,
        including the rare super prizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zombie Invasion Cross‑Server:</strong> During Zombie Invasion,
        teleport to another server where the event is active. After the
        ten‑minute protection ends, rally with an ally and attack the zombie
        boss to earn gold bars and courage medals. This
        method avoids competition on your home server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Daily 90 diamonds:</strong> In the 3v3 Brawl (arena), tap the
        thumbs‑up icons under any three players once per day to receive 30
        diamonds each, for a total of 90 diamonds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extra diamonds from tasks:</strong> After you collect your
        daily task chests, continue completing tasks like recruiting heroes,
        attacking commanders and plundering secret missions. Each grants 10
        bonus diamonds, adding up quickly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Combat &amp; Efficiency Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>War fever stacking:</strong> Scouting or attacking another
        commander (not zombies) triggers a small damage bonus that lasts for
        fifteen minutes. You can retrigger it to keep the buff active, which is
        especially useful during Alliance Exercise and World Boss events.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World Boss damage boost:</strong> Place Mason and Violet in the
        front row to activate their passive bonuses for the back‑row heroes;
        this setup increases your overall DPS against bosses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operation Falcon timing:</strong> Wait until your barracks are
        at a high level before tackling Special Ops. The event rewards free
        troops equal to your highest trainable tier, so delaying gives you
        stronger reinforcements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Honorable Campaign farming:</strong> If you can’t beat the
        next stage, repeatedly clear previous levels. You still earn
        experience and resources, and you can test different hero setups. Use
        the back arrow after starting a fight to skip the combat animation and
        see the result instantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>VIP timing:</strong> Leveling your VIP grants an extra hour of
        VIP time. Purchase a small amount of VIP points when you’re about to
        log in for a long session so that the bonus time doesn’t go to waste.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Base &amp; Survivor Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Alliance healing:</strong> When healing troops, queue exactly as
        many hours as you can receive alliance helps. After your allies reduce
        the timer, finish the remainder with speed‑ups. This makes each help
        count.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emergency hospital cooldown:</strong> After rescuing troops in
        the emergency hospital, leave them in the queue. The two‑day cooldown
        begins immediately even if you don’t claim them, freeing the queue for
        another rescue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Swap survivors between buildings:</strong> Start a research or
        building upgrade with your best survivors in one facility, then move
        them to another building before starting a second project. This lets
        you reuse their bonuses multiple times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use resource tiles for speed and stealth:</strong> Marching
        troops to resource tiles is faster than marching on open ground and
        does not send a notification to enemies. During wars, use these tiles
        to relocate quickly or hide your armies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove wall troops judiciously:</strong> Having no defensive
        troops on your wall means you lose fewer units per attack. This tactic
        is situational – decide whether you want to trade wall troops for
        enemy time or protect your resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Send trucks wisely:</strong> To reduce the chance of your
        trucks being plundered, delay sending them until most players have
        exhausted their attacks or dispatch them with only your first and
        second squads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dispose of troops before training day:</strong> Prior to troop
        training day in a duel week, march your weakest squad repeatedly
        against zombies or join alliance exercises until they are wiped. This
        frees space to train higher‑level troops for points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secret mission views:</strong> In the Secret Missions event
        interface, a small number appears next to each mission showing how
        many commanders have viewed it. A high number means there may be
        plunderers waiting.
      </li>
    </ul>
