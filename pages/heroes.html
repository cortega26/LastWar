      <h1>Heroes &amp; Tier List</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      Heroes lead your squads into battle and provide powerful bonuses. Each
      hero belongs to a class (tank, damage dealer or support) and wields
      unique skills that synergise with certain troops. Investing in the
      right heroes is key to dominating PvE and PvP content.
    </p>

    <h2>Hero Roles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tanks:</strong> These heroes soak damage and protect your
        damage dealers. Some tanks also provide buffs or crowd control. Notable
        tanks include <em>Marshall</em>, who also buffs allies, and
        <em>Kimberly</em>, an offensive tank with high survivability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Damage dealers:</strong> Focused on dealing massive damage,
        these heroes shine when paired with the right troops. Examples include
        <em>DVA</em> and <em>Morrison</em> for aircraft squads, and
        <em>Tesla</em> and <em>Fiona</em> for missile squads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support:</strong> Support heroes provide healing, buffs or
        debuffs. <em>Mason</em> boosts back‑row damage and healing, while
        <em>Murphy</em> offers strong defensive buffs. Having a good support
        hero dramatically increases your army’s survivability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Top Heroes</h2>
    <p>
      The following tier list highlights the most valuable heroes in the
      current meta. Focus on upgrading SS and S tier heroes; avoid sinking too
      many resources into lower tiers unless they fill a specific role for
      your squad.
    </p>

    <h3>SS Tier</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Marshall (Tank Support):</strong> A versatile tank who
        reduces damage taken, heals allies and increases squad survivability.
        Marshall remains dominant across all seasons and scales well with
        Desert Blessing buffs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kimberly (Tank Attack):</strong> Combines the bulk of a tank
        with high damage. She is easy to acquire early on and remains useful
        through late game, especially when paired with tanks or rocket troops.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DVA (Aircraft Attack):</strong> One of the highest damage
        dealers in the game. DVA excels in both PvE and PvP content and
        synergises with aircraft troops for devastating aerial strikes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Morrison (Aircraft Attack):</strong> Works alongside DVA as a
        second aircraft damage dealer, making aircraft squads extremely
        potent. Morrison’s skills amplify critical hits and burst damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tesla (Missile Attack):</strong> A premier missile hero who
        increases rocket damage and triggers powerful area‑of‑effect attacks.
        Tesla pairs well with missile troops and shines during world boss
        battles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fiona (Missile Attack):</strong> Another top rocket hero,
        Fiona buffs missile damage and provides sustained DPS. She is
        particularly effective when combined with Tesla.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>S Tier</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Williams:</strong> A balanced hero with strong attack and
        defensive stats. Williams excels in mixed squads and is a solid
        investment if you lack SS tier heroes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mason:</strong> A support hero who boosts healing and
        back‑row damage. Mason is invaluable in Alliance Exercise and world
        boss events.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Murphy:</strong> Provides defensive buffs and crowd control,
        making him ideal for tanking world boss hits and protecting fragile
        damage dealers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Carlie, Stetmann, Lucius, Schuyler, Adam &amp; Swift:</strong> These
        heroes offer a mix of offensive and defensive skills. While not quite
        SS tier, they are still excellent additions to specialised squads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Tier</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mason, Violet, &amp; McGregor:</strong> Good
        performers who can fill gaps in your roster. They are worth
        investing in if you already have your SS and S tier heroes sorted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As new heroes are released in future seasons, the meta may shift.
      Always check the latest patch notes and community discussions to decide
      which heroes to upgrade. Prioritise heroes that complement your main
      troop type and fit your preferred play style.
