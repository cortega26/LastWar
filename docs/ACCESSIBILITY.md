# Accessibility Guidelines

Use descriptive alternative text for images following the template:

```
<context>: <concise description>
```

- Give readers the necessary context before the description.
- If an image is purely decorative, use an empty `alt=""`.
- Include explicit `width` and `height` or an `aspect-ratio` attribute to reserve layout space.

Examples:
- `Farm overview: workers harvesting crops`
- `Progress chart: immune protein levels over time`
