# Last War Tools

This repository contains a small static website that provides calculators, rules, and guides for **Last War: Survival Game**. The pages are written in HTML, styled with CSS, and rely on a little JavaScript to load the navigation bar and footer on every page.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The navigation links lead to additional calculators and information.

## Development

No build step is required. Simply edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files and reload your browser. The `assets/js/script.js` file uses jQuery to fetch the navigation and footer from the `partials/` directory, keeping all pages consistent.

## Monetization Ideas

- Add a "Buy Me a Coffee" button to let visitors donate.
- Offer premium calculator features or ad-free browsing for supporters.
- Display unobtrusive advertisements from a network such as Google AdSense.
